Verify Visualization:

The screen should resize to 400x300 and display the projection (red/green points, as seen previously).
Use controls:

x/y/z: Cycle projection axes.
0-9: Select dimension for movement.
Up/Down: Move camera along selected dimension.
+/-: Adjust focal length.
r: Refresh data.




Check for Black Screen:

If the screen remains black, note whether it’s during the configuration phase (no input boxes) or after entering dimensions (no projection).
Share the console output, especially any errors.
