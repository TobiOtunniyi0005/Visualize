Oh, Got it. There is the center angle.
They choose where they want to land. Get the angle to the center of the screen and then move a little bit more. This is in radians.
If it is on the screen then it is published.
The points will plot themselves from  now on.
The angles would be pre-set into the pixels from now on and the dots would then ask what angles they go in.
Now you can rotate the screen as well as increase its size and I already have the pixel rules so. I am ready.
If a bunch of pixels are added the closest one is added and then the old ones are removed first and it is placed in the right angle positions.
